This site is a collection of 20+ years of tickering, research, caffeine nights and more around my journey as a developer.  Each bug solved and syntax error conquered, I learnt something that might (or not) be useful to someone else.

I used (and abused) a lot from Stack Overflow over the years so I will try to give back as much as I can to the community with this [blog](https://oaxley.github.io/blog/).

If you find something useful here, don't hesitate to send me an [email](mailto:oaxley@duck.com).
