# Having fun with the Arduino

I have acquired some time ago an Arduino Uno R3 (and a RPi 4) and I hadn't the time to play with it until now...

As I did not use a microcontroller for some time (at least since my Master), I wanted to start with something simple.  
And what can be more funny and with the mystical allure of the Magic 8 Ball â€“ that enigmatic orb that holds the answers 
to life's most pressing questions (or so it claims).

## The ingredients

Here are the list of materials you will need:

| Quantity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Arduino Uno (Rev3) |
| 1 | LCD 16x2 |
| 3 | LED (Red/Yellow/Green) |
| 4 | Resistor 220 Ohms |
| 1 | Resistor 1 KOhms |
| 1 | Pushbutton |
| 1 | Potentiometer |

## Connecting everything

Follow the schema to connect all the parts together:

The 3 LED will be used when the 'Oracle' is thinking.

## The code

### The Setup

The setup is pretty easy. We initialize the LEDs as well as the LCD.  
We then set the PIN #2 in INPUT mode, and intialize the random number generator.

``` c
void setup() {
  // LED + LCD setups
  ledSetup();
  lcdSetup();

  // switch setup
  pinMode(2, INPUT);

  // initialize random generator
  randomSeed(analogRead(0));
}
```

### The main loop

The main loop can be describe in steps:

1. Print the invite on the LCD
2. Wait for the user to push the button
3. Perform the thinking animation
4. Generate a new random number
5. Print the answer and wait 10s before starting again

``` c
void loop() {
  // print the invite to the user
  lcdPrintInvite();

  // wait for the button to be pressed
  int switchState = digitalRead(2);
  while (switchState == LOW) {
    delay(100);
    switchState = digitalRead(2);
  }

  // start the LED animation
  lcdPrintThinking();
  ledAnimation();

  // get a random number [0, 19]
  int index = random(0, 20);

  // print the Magic8 answer
  lcdPrintAnswer(index);

  // wait 10s
  delay(10000);
}
```

### The LCD and LED animations

All the responses from the Magic-8 ball are hard-coded in the `LCDAnim.ino` file. Because the LCD is 8x16 characters, each response is split between two lines.

The LED are animated by moving from LOW state to HIGH state until they are all HIGH, then we set them one by one to LOW state.

## Conclusion

It was definitely worth the few hours to design and code, and definitely a good small project to get your feets wet on the Arduino!
