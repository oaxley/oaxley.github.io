# First step in the Sim

As a casual user of [X-Plane 12](https://www.x-plane.com/), I always wanted to link the sim with the real life.  
Having my very own cockpit is a dream, but a dream that can be very expensive.  

But if having my own cockpit is currently not realistic, at least with my Arduino I can have a taste of it.  
With this project, we will build a simple radio controller. You interact with it in "Real Life" and it will update the SIM in real time!

## X-Plane 12

### Communication

By default, X-Plane is listening on UDP port 49000 to receive commands. The response (if there is) will be coming from UDP port 49001.

The **DATAREF** we will be using is `sim/cockpit/radios/com1_freq_hz` which correspond to the active 1st radio COM.

To see if the setup is currently working, we can do it with bash.  
The following command will switch the COM1 frequency to `123.450`.

``` bash
python -c 'import struct, sys; \
value=struct.pack("<5sf500s", b"DREF\0",12344 , b"sim/cockpit/radios/com1_freq_hz\0"); \
sys.stdout.buffer.write(value)' > /dev/udp/192.168.0.1/49000
```

### Protocol

We need to alternate between RREF, to retrieve the current value of the simulator, and DREF to set the value in the simulator.
RREF will start streaming the value from the simulator, in order to be as efficient as possible with the network, we will switch off
the streaming as soon as we have a stable reading value.

## Arduino

### The materials

| Quantity | Description             |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| 1        | Arduino Uno (Rev3)      |
| 1        | LCD 16x2                |
| 1        | Resistor 220 Ohms       |
| 1        | Potentiometer 250 KOhms |
| 1        | Rotary Encoder Module   |

### The schematics

The schematics is very simple as we need only a few components:

### Reading the value

The rotary encoder is used to set the COM1 value in "Real Life".
The "push" mode is used to switch between the integer and fractional part of the frequency.

Once the value is "stable", it is sent to the serial interface of the Arduino to be read by the python program.

## Python

The python program connects to the serial interface (for the Arduino) and to X-Plane UDP port.  

Everytime a new value is available on the serial port, it sends the corresponding DREF to X-Plane.

### Serial communication

``` python
import serial

DEFAULT_SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/ttyACM0'
DEFAULT_SERIAL_BAUD = 9600

class SerialCOM:
    """Class to communicate with the Arduino over Serial port"""

    def __init__(self, port: str = DEFAULT_SERIAL_PORT, baud: int = DEFAULT_SERIAL_BAUD) -> None:
        """Constructor"""
        self.port = port
        self.baud = baud

    def connect(self) -> None:
        """Connect to the serial port"""
        self.serial = serial.Serial(self.port, self.baud)

    def sendData(self, data: str) -> None:
        """Send data to serial port"""
        self.serial.write(data.encode())

    def recvData(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """Recv data from the serial port"""
        data = self.serial.readline()
        if not data:
            return None
        
        data = data.decode().rstrip('\n\r')
        return data
```


### UDP Connection

``` python
def connect(self) -> None:
    """Create the UDP connection to X-Plane"""
    self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    self.sock.settimeout(UDP_SOCK_TIMEOUT)
    self.sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_MULTICAST_TTL, struct.pack('b', UDP_SOCK_MAX_TTL))
```

### Dataref

``` python
def setDREF(self, name: str, value: float) -> None:
    """Set a DREF value in X-Plane"""
    # prepare the data
    command = b'DREF\x00'
    dataref = name.encode() + b'\x00'
    dataref = dataref.ljust(500)

    # pack the data according
    message = struct.pack("<5sf500s", command, value, dataref)

    # send the data to X-Plane
    self.sock.sendto(message, (self.udp_host, self.udp_port))

```
