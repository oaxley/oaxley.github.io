# Chip8 Emulator

This is our second post on our Chip8 Emulator. If you need a refresher, you can consult the first part [here](https://oaxley.github.io/chip8/emulator/2020/06/30/chip8-part1.html).
In today's post, we will review the C++17 implementation. Checkout the code from our [github](https://github.com/oaxley/chip8) page to easily follow through the explanations. We will study each files one by one.

## **main.cpp**

As its name suggests, that's the main entry point for the emulator. The code is self explanatory and require no particular attention.

``` cpp
VM myVM;

// initialize the Virtual Machine
myVM.init();

// load the ROM
myVM.loadRom(argv[1]);

// run the VM
myVM.run();

// shutdown the VM
myVM.shutdown();
```

## **keyboard.cpp**

This class defines the mapping between our standard US keyboard and the hexadecimal keyboard of the Chip8 virtual computer.

``` cpp
// mapping
std::map<int, int> keymap;

// ...
keymap[120] = 0x00
// ...
```

The main function *update* read the value from a SDL2 event and set the flags in memory.

``` cpp
// find the key in the mapping
auto it = keymap.find((int)e.key.keysym.sym);

// ...

// set the bit to 1 for this key
if( e.type == SDL_KEYDOWN ) {
    status = status | value;
}

// reset the bit to 0 for this key
// ~value is the opposite of value, binary-wise
if( e.type == SDL_KEYUP ) {
    status = status & ~value;
}
```

## **mmu.cpp**

MMU stands for Memory Management Unit and as its name suggests, this class is indeed responsible to control memory access.
We use a byte array to simulate the Chip8 memory and upon creation all the blocks are set to 0.

``` cpp
MMU::MMU() :
    memory_(new (std::nothrow) byte_t [MemoryZone::TOTAL_MEMORY_SIZE])
{
    // memory was not allocated properly
    if( memory_ == nullptr ) {
        throw MMUError("Unable to allocate main memory space.");
    }
    ::memset(memory_.get(), 0, MemoryZone::TOTAL_MEMORY_SIZE);
}
```

The class exposes several methods:

- read a byte from a memory address
- read a word from a memory address
- write a byte to a memory address
- write a word to a memory address
- load the memory with some data

Reading a byte is just a matter of controlling the boundaries and returning the associated value from the array.

``` cpp
byte_t MMU::readB(word_t address) const
{
    byte_t value;

    // address is beyond accessible memory
    if( address >= MemoryZone::UPPER_MEMORY_LIMIT ) {
        throw MMUError("Address outside of memory boundaries.");
    }

    return memory_[address];
}
```

For a word, it's even simpler as it is a combination of two bytes. 
Don't forget that the Chip8 is of "Big Endian" type, so you read the MSB first and you need to shift left this value.

``` cpp
word_t MMU::readW(word_t address) const
{
    return ((readB(address) << 8) | readB(address + 1));
}
```

Writing is similar, except that we need to ensure we don't write inadvertently to the ROM zone.

``` cpp
void MMU::writeB(word_t address, byte_t value)
{
    if( address >= MemoryZone::UPPER_MEMORY_LIMIT ) {
        throw MMUError("Address outside of memory boundaries.");
    }

    // this part is read only
    if( (address >= MemoryZone::ROM_BEGIN) && (address <= MemoryZone::ROM_END)) {
        throw MMUError("Trying to write into Read Only memory.");
    }

    memory_[(int)address] = value;
}
```

## **display.cpp**

This class is in charge of displaying the rendering buffer onto the screen with the help of the SDL2 library.
As the initial screen resolution was small (64x32) we apply a scale factor. 
Each original pixel is replaced by a square of 8x8 on the screen.

```cpp
void Display::render()
{
    // get a pointer to the screen data in memory
    byte_t *ptr = data_->pMMU->getPointer(MemoryZone::SCREEN_BEGIN);

    // retrieve the values from memory
    int width  = data_->pMMU->readW(MemoryRegister::SCREEN_WIDTH);
    int height = data_->pMMU->readW(MemoryRegister::SCREEN_HEIGHT);
    int xscale = data_->pMMU->readB(MemoryRegister::SCREEN_XSCALE);
    int yscale = data_->pMMU->readB(MemoryRegister::SCREEN_YSCALE);

    // set the SDL Rect structure
    SDL_Rect r;
    r.w = xscale;
    r.h = yscale;

    // reset the screen
    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(data_->pRenderer, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF);
    SDL_RenderClear(data_->pRenderer);

    // set the drawing color
    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(data_->pRenderer, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF);

    // render the screen
    for( int y = 0; y < height; y++)
    {
        int offset = y * width;
        r.y = y * yscale;
        for(int x = 0; x < width; x++)
        {
            if( ptr[offset + x] ) {
                r.x = x * xscale;
                SDL_RenderFillRect(data_->pRenderer, &r);
            }
        }
    }

    SDL_RenderPresent(data_->pRenderer);
}
```

## **cpu.cpp**

This file is the heart of the Chip8 emulation, but before diving in, we need to review some helper functions.

### **putPixel**

This function is in charge of setting a pixel on the rendering buffer. 
As seen in the previous installment of this series, the new pixel is XORed with the pixel at the same location.
Below, the truth table for XOR operator
```
XOR truth table
 X | Y | Z
---+---+---
 0 | 0 | 0
 0 | 1 | 1
 1 | 0 | 1
 1 | 1 | 0
```

If the operation results in a pixel being erased (Z=0), we need to set the VF flag to 1.

``` cpp
bool CPU::OpaqueData::putPixel(int x, int y)
{
    int offset = y * screenWidth + x;
    bool isCollision {false};

    if( pScreen[offset] == 1 )
        isCollision = true;

    pScreen[offset] ^= 1;

    return isCollision;
}
```

Here we're just returning a boolean to indicate a collision or not.
Now the reason as to why this function is here, is purely separation of duty. 
The CPU works with the rendering buffer, without knowing if a display is attached to it or not.
This way, the display does not have to implement a collision mechanism and can be a simple LCD screen or anything that can set a pixel on or off.
Even a giant [screen](https://hackaday.com/2019/05/17/a-ping-pong-ball-led-video-wall/) made of ping-pong balls can work.

### **reset**

This function will reset the CPU to its initial state, by zeroing the memory and the registers.
The Program Counter is set back to 0x200 which is its default value

``` cpp
// Reset the CPU
void CPU::OpaqueData::reset()
{
    I = MemoryZone::ROM_BEGIN;
    PC = MemoryZone::CODE_BEGIN;
    SP = MemoryZone::STACK_END;

    ::memset(&V[0], 0x00, NUM_REGISTERS);
    ::srand(::time(NULL));
}
```

### **update**

This function is where the magic happens, and like a real CPU, we follow the same pattern:

- Fetch the opcode
- Decode the opcode
- Execute the opcode

Fetching the opcode is just a matter of reading a word at the location pointed by the PC.
After this operation, we move the PC forward by 2 bytes as each opcode is 16 bits.

``` cpp
// read the next instruction
auto opcode = data_->pMMU->readW(data_->PC);

// increment PC to next instruction
data_->PC += 2;
```

For this CPU, decoding means we compute some values based on the opcode value itself.
These values will be used later on during the execution process.

``` cpp
// retrieve values from the opcode
auto addr = (opcode & 0x0FFF);
auto x = (opcode & 0x0F00) >> 8;
auto y = (opcode & 0x00F0) >> 4;
auto value = (opcode & 0x00FF);
```

Now the best part, the execution. The number of opcode is limited, so we can perform this efficiently with a switch/case.
Because each opcode belongs to a specific group, we can reduce the number of cases by looking only at the 4 most significant bit of the opcode.
We end up with a structure identical to this one:

``` cpp
// look only the 4 msb
switch(opcode & 0xF000)
{
    case 0x0000:
        // 1st group
    case 0x1000:
        // 2nd group
    case 0x2000:
    // and so on...
    
    // until the end
    case 0xF000:
        // last group
}
```

Afterwards, it's just a matter of filling blank either with an if statement or a switch/case again.

Let's explore in details some parts of the code.

#### **Jump**

The jump instruction "JP addr" is encoded within the group 0x1xxx. The last 3 nibbles being the address.
The associated code is quite simple:

``` cpp
case 0x1000:    // JP addr
    data_->PC = addr;
    break;
```
We set the Program Counter to this new address.

#### **Call and Ret**

The Call (and its counterpart Ret) instruction is a bit different than Jump as it plays with the stack pointer (SP).
SP logic is the opposite of the program counter. At the beginning of the emulation, SP is set to the end of the memory allocated to the stack.
Every time we push something on the stack, SP is decreased. On the opposite, we need to increase SP after pulling from the stack.
This way we ensure that neither SP nor PC collide. 

``` cpp
case 0x00EE:    // RET
    // retrieve the value at the location pointed by SP
    // set PC to this value
    data_->PC = data_->pMMU->readW(data_->SP);

    // increase SP by 2
    data_->SP += 2;
    break;
// [...]
case 0x2000:    // CALL addr
    // decrease SP by 2
    data_->SP -= 2;

    // store the value of PC at the location pointed by SP
    data_->pMMU->writeW(data_->SP, data_->PC);

    // set PC to the address extracted from the opcode
    data_->PC = addr;
    break;
```

#### **Skip if Equal/Not Equal**

Skip if Equal (SE) and Skip if Not Equal (SNE) act like a near jump. 
Instead of jumping to an arbitrary location, they skip the next instruction.
If you remember, we said that the PC already points to the next opcode. 
So if the equality is true, we need to increment PC by two again to skip this instruction.

``` cpp
case 0x3000:    // Skip next instruction if Vx == byte
    if( data_->V[x] ==  value)
        data_->PC += 2;
    break;

case 0x4000:    // Skip next instruction if Vx != byte
    if( data_->V[x] !=  value)
        data_->PC += 2;
    break;
```

#### **Draw Sprite**

Drawing a sprite involves reading the pixels from the memory and setting the correspondent bits on the screen. 
The size of the sprite comes from the last opcode's nibble. Vx and Vy point to the sprite target location on the screen. 
Finally, the special register I holds the location of the sprite definition.

``` cpp
case 0xD000:    // DRW Vx, Vy, n
    {
        byte_t height = opcode & 0x000F;

        data_->V[Register::VF] = 0;
        for (int row = 0; row < height; row++)
        {
            byte_t sprite = data_->pMMU->readB(data_->I + row);
            for(int col = 0; col < Constants::SPRITE_WIDTH; col++)
            {
                // check the upper bit only
                if( (sprite & 0x80) > 0 )
                {
                    // if this is true then a collision occurred
                    if( data_->putPixel(data_->V[x] + col, data_->V[y] + row) )
                        data_->V[Register::VF] = 1;
                }

                // next bit
                sprite <<= 1;
            }
        }
    }
    break;
```

Instead of doing complex bit manipulation to retrieve each pixels, we consider only the Most Significant Bit.
With a Left Shift we are able to read all the pixels easily.


#### **Wait for Key Press***

Wait for a Key Press stop the interpreter until a key is pressed. The main issue with that is the timers' update.
On a real machine, the timers are counters inside a component and linked to a clock. 
On an emulator we can't block the whole process. The solution presented here is more elegant. 
We decrease the Program Counter to make it point to the same instruction. This way we ensure the remaining of the emulator can still be run.


``` cpp
case 0x000A:  // LD Vx, K
    {
        int key = (data_->pMMU->readW(MemoryRegister::KEYBOARD_STATUS));
        if( key == 0 )
            data_->PC -= 2;
        else
        {
            int vx = 1;
            int mask = vx;
            while( (key & mask) != mask) {
                vx += 1;
                mask = 1 << vx;
            }

            data_->V[x] = vx;
        }
    }
    break;
```

## **vm.cpp**

If the CPU is the heart of the emulator, this class is the head. The *run* method executes a loop that follows the cycle:

- Read the keyboard and update the corresponding flags
- Run a couple of CPU cycles according to the current speed
- Update the screen 
- Update the timers at 1/60s 

### **Reading the Keyboard**

To read the keyboard the SDL2 provides the function *SDL_PollEvent*. 
The result of this function is then passed to the Keyboard *update* to set the proper flags in memory.

``` cpp
// read the keyboard
if( SDL_PollEvent(&e) != 0 ) {
    if( e.type == SDL_QUIT )
        quit = true;
    else
    {
        // ...
        
        // update the keyboard flag
        data_->keyboard->update(e);
        
        // ...
    }
}
```

### **Running some CPU cycles**

We run some CPU cycle according to the current speed of the emulator. 

``` cpp
// update the CPU
for(int i=0; i<speed; i++)
    data_->cpu->update()
```

### **Updating the screen**

The previous operation will probably update the rendering buffer (with the dedicated Draw Sprite instruction) so we need to display it on the screen.

``` cpp
    data_->display->render()
```

### **Updating the timers**

According to the Chip8 specifications, the timers should be updated 60 times per second.
To realize that, we need to use the [SDL_GetTicks](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetTicks) function from SDL2 and do some basic arithmetic. 

The function returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since the beginning of the process. 
We should refresh our timers at 1/60s or 1,000/60 ms. This is our framerate. The minimum amount between two refresh. 

``` cpp
int fps = 60;                   // frame per seconds
int framerate = 1000/fps;       // framerate
int lasttime = SDL_GetTicks();  // current tick value

// ...

// the delta between now and before should be
// at least equal to the framerate
if( SDL_GetTicks() - lasttime >= framerate ) {

    // update timers
    data_->updateTimers();

    // update time variable
    lasttime = SDL_GetTicks();
}
```

We keep a variable *lasttime* that contains the previous Tick value. We then compare the current value with the previous one and see if it's greater than our framerate.
If yes, we update the timers and don't forget to retake the measurement for the next iteration.



## **a disassembler**

That's it for today. Next time we will implement a disassembler because they are no better way to learn than studying other people codes. 
In the meantime, if you want to play you can find some ROMS in the public domain [here](https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html).
