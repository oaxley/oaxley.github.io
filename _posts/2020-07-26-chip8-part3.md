# Chip8 Disassembler

As we continue our journey in the world of emulation, it's time for us to implement a Chip8 ROM disassembler. It's an essential tool to understand and discover how hardware works.
If you just join us, you can have a look at our two precedent Chip8 posts on the subject:

- [part 1](https://oaxley.github.io/chip8/emulator/2020/06/30/chip8-part1.html) : Hardware
- [part 2](https://oaxley.github.io/chip8/emulator/2020/07/12/chip8-part2.html) : The Emulator

## What is a disassembler?

A disassembler takes as an input a series of bytes code and outputs a program in assembly language comprehensible by humans.
So it goes from this:

```
00000000: a2b4 23e6 22b6 7001 d011 3025 1206 71ff  ..#.".p...0%..q.
00000010: d011 601a d011 6025 3100 120e c470 4470  ..`...`%1....pDp
```

to this:

```
    LD   I, 2B4                   ; A2B4
    CALL 3E6                      ; 23E6
    CALL 2B6                      ; 22B6
    ADD  V0, #01                  ; 7001
    DRW  V0, V1, #01              ; D011
    SE   V0, #25                  ; 3025
    JP   206                      ; 1206
    ADD  V1, #FF                  ; 71FF
    DRW  V0, V1, #01              ; D011
    LD   V0, #1A                  ; 601A
    DRW  V0, V1, #01              ; D011
    LD   V0, #25                  ; 6025
    SE   V1, #00                  ; 3100
    JP   20E                      ; 120E
    RND  V4, #70                  ; C470
    SNE  V4, #70                  ; 4470

```

A disassembler does not execute the code to "de-compile" it. It should interpret the byte code and its meaning by just reading it.
Before going in details into our code, let's review the simplest method available: the naive way.

## The Naive Way

As a refresher, Chip8 opcodes are 16-bit wide and programs start at address 0x0200. So we take one opcode after another, decode it and print it on the screen.
This works as long as the Program Counter (PC) value remains an even value. Some CPU enforces that rule but not the Chip8.
That means any instructions that modify the PC (like "Jump") can set an odd value.

Let's review an example with the bytes code below extracted from the rom BLITZ by David WINTER:

```
00000000: 1217 424c 4954 5a20 4279 2044 6176 6964  ..BLITZ By David
00000010: 2057 494e 5445 52a3 4160 0461 0962 0e67   WINTER.A`.a.b.g
00000020: 04d0 1ef2 1e70 0c30 4012 21f0 0a00 e022  .....p.0@.!...."
00000030: d9f0 0a00 e08e 70a3 1e6b 1fcc 1f8c c4dc  ......p..k......
```

We decode each opcode and generate the corresponding assembly lines:

```
    JP   #217                     ; 1217
    SNE  V2, #4C                  ; 424C
    SNE  V9, #54                  ; 4954
    SE   V10, V2                  ; 5A20
    SNE  V2, #79                  ; 4279
    CALL #044                     ; 2044
    LD   V1, #76                  ; 6176
    LD   V9, #64                  ; 6964
    CALL #057                     ; 2057
    SNE  V9, #4E                  ; 494E
    SE   V4, V4                   ; 5445
    SE   V2, V10                  ; 52A3
    SNE  V1, #60                  ; 4160
    ??                            ; 0461
    ??                            ; 0962
    ??                            ; 0E67
    ??                            ; 04D0
    JP   #EF2                     ; 1EF2
    JP   #E70                     ; 1E70
    ??                            ; 0C30
    SNE  V0, #12                  ; 4012
    CALL #1F0                     ; 21F0
    ??                            ; 0A00
    ??                            ; E022
    DRW  V9, V15, #0              ; D9F0
    ??                            ; 0A00
    ??                            ; E08E
    ADD  V0, #A3                  ; 70A3
    JP   #E6B                     ; 1E6B
    JP   #FCC                     ; 1FCC
    JP   #F8C                     ; 1F8C
    RND  V4, #DC                  ; C4DC
```

We clearly see that something is wrong here. The disassembler failed to decode some instructions. And for the rest, the flow seems weird, like the 3 unconditional jumps at the end.
We can trace back the problem to the very first opcode "JP #217". The target address for the Jump is an odd number so our naive approach can't work.
What we decode as opcodes were in fact a text marker in the ROM visible in the bytes code above. It was a common method back then and the purpose of the jump is to pass over it.
You can of course start again the disassembler from address #217 and do it as many time as you need. In the end, you will have to assemble all the pieces to get the full assembly code.
It's tedious but it can work.

Hopefully there is a better way.

## The better way

To fully understand the code, the disassembler has no choice than follow the flow. And for this, to interact with the PC and the opcodes associated with it.
For the Chip8 these are:

- Jump
- Call and Ret
- Skip if Equal (SE) and Skip if Not Equal (SNE)
- Skip if Pressed (SKP) and Skip if Not Pressed (SKNP)

A word of caution here. There is one opcode that if encountered, will stop the disassembler. This instruction is "JP V0, addr".
The content of V0 is added to an address to decide where to jump at runtime.
And because this is potentially a jump to anywhere in the code, we can't properly go on with the disassembly.
Fortunately, this instruction was barely used so most of the available Chip8 roms would be ok.

Back to our disassembler. The process acts in 2 phases.
The first one will try to infer the portion of the ROM that are actually code by following the flow. During this phase we also record the destination to mark the code later on.
The second phase prints out the code and the data in a nicely format.

### Code discovery

For this step, we use a queue to store the addresses discovered along the path and a set to record all the targets.

```cpp
// queue to register all the code segments to identify
std::queue<uint16_t> segments;

// target addresses
std::set<uint16_t> labels_;
```

The part of the ROM identified as code are marked in a map.

```cpp
// the code map
std::set<uint16_t> codemap_;
```

The mainloop will process the queue and follow the code to mark it as such and see where it leads.
The flow is altered depending on the opcode read.

Let's review these opcodes in detail.

#### Jump

JP is an unconditional jump. The only thing we need to do is to set the PC to this new address and record it in the labels.

```cpp
case 0x1000:    // JUMP
    PC_ = opcode & 0x0FFF;      // unconditional jump
    labels_.insert(PC_);        // record the destination label
    break;
```

#### Call and Ret

Call acts like Jump except that when a RET is reached, it should return just after the instruction.

For call, we add the current address to the queue before modifying the PC

```cpp
case 0x2000:    // CALL
    segments.push(PC_);         // add a new segment to check
    PC_ = opcode & 0x0FFF;
    labels_.insert(PC_);        // record the destination label
    break;
```

Once we reach the RET instruction we stop the current loop and move to the next element in the queue

```cpp
// this is a RET so we stop here
if( opcode == 0x00EE )
    break;
```

#### Skip if ... (SE/SNE/SKP/SKNP)

For these opcodes, the behavior is identical. A jump follows the instruction most of the time so we just add the next instruction address to the queue.

```cpp
case 0x3000:    // SE
case 0x4000:    // SNE
case 0x5000:    // SE
case 0x9000:    // SNE
    segments.push(PC_ + 2);     // add a new segment to check
    break;

case 0xE000:    // SKP & SKNP
    switch(opcode & 0xF0FF)
    {
        case 0xE09E:    // SKP
        case 0xE0A1:    // SKNP
            segments.push(PC_ + 2);
            break;
    }
    break;
```

#### LD I, addr

This opcode is not modifying the flow but load the Index register with an address.
As with the Jump, it can be useful to identify these segments of data with a label, so we do it during the discovery.

```cpp
// this is to record the address for the Index register
case 0xA000:    // LD I, addr
    labels_.insert(opcode & 0x0FFF);
    break;
```

### Rendering

Once we have the code map and the labels, we can render on the screen the assembly code.
For that, we parse the ROM once again and proceed this way:

- if the address is in the labels, we prefix it with an 'L' to create a unique name
- if the address contains data, we print its content as hexadecimal values and increment the program counter by 1
- if the address is in the code map, we decode the opcode, print it and increment the program counter by 2

We perform these operations until we reach the end of the ROM.

#### Format

The format for the disassembler output follows some common conventions.

- the labels are on a separate line and end up with a colon ':'
- comments start with a semi-colon ';'
- the opcode value is printed out in comment on the same line where it appears
- all the values are in hexadecimal and prefixed by a pound '#'
- data are denoted by a 'DB' (Data Byte)

Example:

```assembly
;----------------------------------------------------
; ROM Name: BLITZ
; ROM Size: 391 Bytes
;----------------------------------------------------
    JP   L217                     ; 1217
    DB   42, 4C, 49, 54
    DB   5A, 20, 42, 79
    DB   20, 44, 61, 76
    DB   69, 64, 20, 57
    DB   49, 4E, 54, 45
    DB   52
L217:
    LD   I, L341                  ; A341
    LD   V0, #04                  ; 6004
    LD   V1, #09                  ; 6109
    LD   V2, #0E                  ; 620E
    LD   V7, #04                  ; 6704
L221:
    DRW  V0, V1, #0E              ; D01E
    ADD  I, V2                    ; F21E
    ADD  V0, #0C                  ; 700C
    SE   V0, #40                  ; 3040
    JP   L221                     ; 1221
    LD   V0, K                    ; F00A
```

This is definitely a nice improvement from the bytes code and easier to read and understand.

## Compilation

The code is available from our [GitHub](https://github.com/oaxley/chip8) page.

The CMakefile has a new target to compile the disassembler (c8dasm).
To keep things consistent, the emulator is now available as "c8run".

```cmake
# Chip8 runtime
add_executable(c8run src/cpu.cpp src/display.cpp src/keyboard.cpp src/main.cpp src/mmu.cpp src/vm.cpp)
target_link_libraries(c8run ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})

# Chip8 disassembler
add_executable(c8dasm src/disassembler.cpp src/c8dasm.cpp)
```

The disassembly of any ROMs can be done with

```bash
$ c8dasm <romfile>
```

## Last episode

That's it for the Chip8 ROM disassembler. You have now an ideal tool to disassemble and understand how the ROMs made by great developers were made.
This is an invaluable tool in the comprehension of a new hardware.

For our next episode, and probably the last one on the subject, we will implement the opposite operation: a compiler.

You will be able to create your own ROM with all the knowledge you've gained so far.

Until then, happy disassembly!
