# Hardware Simulation

In this post, and the next ones, we will explore the domain of Hardware Simulation also known as Emulation.
Companies uses simulation to avoid bearing the expensive costs of hardware during proof of concept or development phases. Indeed, there is no points of paying huge some of money if you're not gonna use the hardware at the end. Same goes true during training of junior resources. You don't want them to burn a precious components while their learn the ropes on a new assignment.
Our target is to build a Chip8 computer emulator. It's not too complex and to add some challenges we will do it in C++ and uses the SDL2 for rendering.
Hopes you will enjoy the ASCII arts too :)

## **Chip8 presentation**

Chip8 is an interpreted language that allowed hobbyists to easily create games for the Chip8 Virtual Machine in the 70's.
It was created by Joseph Weisecker and the VM was available on old microcomputers like the COSMAC VIP or Telmac 1800.
Games (aka ROMS) were published in magazines in hex format. Some went as far as create a real machine from VM (Dream 6800).

For our implementation, we took some liberties with the initial design but nothing too fancy.
Our emulator runs the old ROMs perfectly, but as room for enhancement.

Without further due, let's dive into the VM specifications.

### **Memory**

The init VM had only 4KB of memory (1000h) with the first 512 ones reserved for the interpreter (which does not exist anymore).
Instead this space is now used for the 4x5 hexadecimal font to draw characters from 0-9 and A to F.
This means also that all the programs will start at address 200h.

In our VM we have extended the Memory (see mapping below) to leave more space for the code and data.

```
+-----------------------------+ <- 1A20h
|                             |
|  screen buffer (2048 Bytes) |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+ <- 1220h
|                             |
|  peripherals (32 Bytes)     |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+ <- 1200h
|                             |
|  stack (512 Bytes)          |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+ <- 1000h
|                             |
|  Code (3584 Bytes)          |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+ <- 0200h
|                             |
|  ROM (512 Bytes)            |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+ <- 0000h
```

### **Stack**

The initial stack had 16 levels and located at the end of the memory (stack goes backward).
We doubled that to 32 levels and made the stack zone separated from the main memory.
The stack stores mainly the return address when calling a subroutine.

### **Registers**

The VM has 16 general purpose registers named V0 to VF. The Vx registers are all 8-bits. VF is the flag register.
Other registers are:

- A 16-bit program counter (PC)
- A 16-bit stack pointer (SP)
- A 16-bit memory index (I)

When writing to memory, the VM follows the Big Endian architecture (as opposed to Little Endian).
So a 16-bit value is first split in MSB (most significant byte) and LSB (least significant byte) and writes in this order in memory:

```
Example for value ABCDh written at address 1200h

MSB = 0xAB = 1010 1011
LSB = 0xCD = 1100 1101

+---------+-----------------+-------+
| Address | bit 7 ... bit 0 | value |
+---------+-----------------+-------+
|  1200h  | 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 |  ABh  |
+---------+-----------------+-------+
|  1201h  | 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 |  CDh  |
+---------+-----------------+-------+
```

### **Peripherals**

The VM supports two timers and two peripherals. To make things look more "real", the access to peripherals follows the Memory Map I/O principle.
You access peripherals as if they were part of the memory. Each one of them has a specific zone in memory where you can read/write to communicate
with it. The mapping is a 32 bytes zone located after the stack memory.

#### **Timers**

There are two 8-bit timers in the VM that down counts to 0 at a fixed frequency of 60Hz:

- Delay Timer (DT) : mainly used to perform delay loop
- Sound Timer (ST) : used to play a tone until the count reaches 0

#### **Keyboard**

The keyboard, a reminiscence of the 70s era, has 16 keys numbered from 0 to F (in hexa).

The mapping to our english keyboard is:

```
Original Keyboard     English Keyboard
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | C |     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
| 4 | 5 | 6 | D |     | Q | W | E | R |
+---+---+---+---+ ==> +---+---+---+---+
| 7 | 8 | 9 | E |     | A | S | D | F |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
| A | 0 | B | F |     | Z | X | C | V |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
```

The status of each keys is a 16-bit memory value. Each bit corresponds to a key whether it's down (=1) or up (=0).

```
Keyboard 16-bit status register
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 |  9 |  8 |  7 |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +--> Key 0
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +-------> Key 1
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +------------> Key 2
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +-----------------> Key 3
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +----------------------> Key 4
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +---------------------------> Key 5
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +--------------------------------> Key 6
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +-------------------------------------> Key 7
  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    +------------------------------------------> Key 8
  |    |    |    |    |    |    +-----------------------------------------------> Key 9
  |    |    |    |    |    +----------------------------------------------------> Key A
  |    |    |    |    +---------------------------------------------------------> Key B
  |    |    |    +--------------------------------------------------------------> Key C
  |    |    +-------------------------------------------------------------------> Key D
  |    +------------------------------------------------------------------------> Key E
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------> Key F
```

#### **Display**

The display has a width of 64 pixels and a height of 32 pixels.
The resolution was fine in the old days but with today's bigger screens we need to apply a scaling factor of 8 to be able to see something.
Each pixels on the screen is represented by a 8-bit value in the display memory (2048 bytes in total). This leaves room for improvements (RGB colors?).
The upper left corner of the display is (0,0) while the bottom right is (63,31).

There are no primitives to draw lines on the screen. Only sprites that are 8 pixels wide per at maximum 15 pixels long.
When rendering sprites, all the pixels are drawn in XOR mode. If any pixels is set to 0 during drawing operation the flag register is set to 1.
This is a convenient way to detect collision.

```
XOR truth table
 X | Y | Z
---+---+---
 0 | 0 | 0
 0 | 1 | 1
 1 | 0 | 1
 1 | 1 | 0
```

### **Instruction Set**

The instruction set contains only 34 opcodes that are 16-bit wide.
When an opcode needs parameters the encoding follows these rules:

- an address (nnn) : the last 3 nibbles of an opcode
- a 8-bit value (kk) : the least significant byte of the opcode
- a 4-bit value (n) : lowest nibble of the LSB of the opcode
- a 4-bit register index (x) : lowest nibble of the MSB of the opcode
- a 4-bit register index (y) : highest nibble of the LSB of the opcode

## **Until next time**

This conclude the first part of this series on Hardware Simulation aka Emulation. It's already a lot of information to ingest.

Next time, we will go through the C++ implementation. The code is already available on our Github [page](https://github.com/oaxley/chip8) for you to have a look.

Until then, stay masked! :)
