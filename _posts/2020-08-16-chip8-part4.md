# Chip8 Compiler

In this last episode of this series, we will implement a Compiler for our Chip8 emulator in C++.
The goal is to compile the output of our disassembler and get back the original ROM. Hopefully.
Compiling involves different phases that we will review one by one.

If you miss our previous episodes:

- [part 2](https://oaxley.github.io/chip8/emulator/2020/07/12/chip8-part2.html) : The Emulator
- [part 3](https://oaxley.github.io/chip8/emulator/2020/07/26/chip8-part3.html) : The disassembler

So without further due, let's do this!

## Lexer / Parser

The first compilation step is to perform a lexical analysis of the source. This comprises converting a
sequence of characters into a token (aka tokenization) and attaching a meaning to it.

To build tokens, the lexer stores characters in a buffer until it finds a marker or a stop character.
Markers can be a space, a comma or the line end. Each newly formed token will be then assigned a meaning.

Specific features in the token help us deduce its meaning.
If the token starts with a 'V' then we assign the value "REGISTER" to this token.

```c++
// token is a Vx register
if( token_[0] == 'V' ) {
    return std::make_pair(TOKEN_REGISTER, &token_[1]);
}
```

Same if the token begins with a '#' then it's a "VALUE".

```c++
// token is a value
if( token_[0] == '#' ) {
    return std::make_pair(TOKEN_VALUE, &token_[1]);
}
```

If the no value can be assigned or deduced, we assign by default the type "OPERAND.
It will be the role of the compiler to know what to do with it.

The lexer removes also any meaningless part of the sources, like the empty lines or the comments.
When it reaches the end of the file, a specific token is generated (END).

## Compiler

The compiler consumes tokens. Based on the token and its type, it needs to generate the appropriate opcode.
It also keeps track of how many numbers of bytes have been generated since the beginning.
This is akin to the Program Counter we saw earlier and it will becomes handy when dealing with labels.

From here, we have several cases to take care of.

### Labels

Labels does not generate opcode per se. They are particular piece of information that add a marker
to the code. We need to keep a record of all the labels because they will be referenced by the jumps
or calls later on. To do this, we store the current program counter value as well as the label in a
mapping table.

```c++
// token is a label
if( t.first == TOKEN_LABEL ) {
    labels_map[t.second] = PC_;
}
```

### Simple Operands

Simple operands are instruction that do not need any other piece of information to run.
These are "Clear Screen" (CLS) and "Return" (RET).
We just return their corresponding byte codes without any more processing. Very Simple.

```c++
// 00E0 - CLS
if(t.second.compare("CLS") == 0)
    return 0x00E0;

// 00EE - RET
if(t.second.compare("RET") == 0)
    return 0x00EE;
```

### Complex Operands

Complex operands are all the remaining instructions (except Jumps & Calls). Because they require more
information for processing, we need to consume more than one token. And depending on the next token
we can then finely choose the corresponding opcode.

For example, "Load" (LD). The first operand can be a register and the next one a value, leading to
byte codes with the form "6xkk". But if the second operand is a register, we end up with "8xy0".

This "behavior" has to be manually encode for all the instructions.

```c++
// retrieve a first operand
t_token op1 = p->next();
r1 = convert(op1.second);

// Ex9E - SKP Vx
if( t.second.compare("SKP") == 0 )
    return 0xE09E | (r1 & 0x0F) << 8;

// ExA1 - SKNP Vx
if( t.second.compare("SKNP") == 0 )
    return 0xE0A1 | (r1 & 0x0F) << 8;

// retrieve a second operand
t_token op2 = p->next();
r2 = convert(op2.second);

// Cxkk - RND Vx, byte
if( t.second.compare("RND") == 0 )
{
    if( op1.first != TOKEN_REGISTER )
        throw std::string("Invalid first argument in RND operation.");

    if( op2.first != TOKEN_VALUE )
        throw std::string("Invalid second argument in RND operation.");

    return 0xC000 | (r1 & 0x0F) << 8 | (r2 & 0xFF);
}
```

### Jumps and Calls

Jumps and calls involve a different treatment. Most of the time jumps refer to a label we might have seen
before or not. So instead of resolving the jumps now, we defer the resolution to a later stage.
We record in a specific list the current program counter value and the label. We then generate a
dummy opcode to ensure the PC get increased by the correct length.

```c++
if( op1.first == TOKEN_OPERAND ) {
    jumps_table.push_back(std::make_pair(PC, op1.second));
} else {
    throw std::string("Invalid operand in 'JP' instruction.");
}
```

## Jumps Resolution

At the end of the first stage, we have a map that contains labels and their position in the code and
a list of all the jumps with their location and the target label. With this two piece of information
we can resolve all the jumps.

We take each element from the list, retrieve the label and lookup in the map for its corresponding value.
We then replace the placeholder by this value. We repeat this until we consume all the items in the list.

```c++
// resolve the jumps
for(auto jt = jumps_table.begin(); jt != jumps_table.end(); ++jt)
{
    uint16_t offset{jt->first};
    std::string label{jt->second};

    // look for the target address in the map
    auto lm = labels_map.find(label);

    if( lm != labels_map.end() ) {
        // Move the address according to the beginning of the ROM address
        uint16_t value = lm->second + ROM_CODE_BEGIN;

        // replace the placeholders
        ROM_[offset] = ROM_[offset] | (value & 0x0F00) >> 8;
        ROM_[offset+1] = value & 0xFF;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Cannot find label " << label << " in the source." << std::endl;
        return false;
    }
}
```

Once we are done with this, we can safely write the new ROM on disk.

```c++
std::ofstream fh(filename.c_str(), std::ios::out|std::ios::binary);
if( fh.is_open() )
{
    for(int i=0; i < PC_; i++) {
        fh << ROM_[i];
    }
}
fh.close();
std::cout << PC_ << " bytes generated." << std::endl;
```

## Compilation

The code is available from our [GitHub](https://github.com/oaxley/chip8) page.

Like last time, a new target is available in the CMakefile for the compiler (c8asm).

```cmake
# Chip8 runtime
add_executable(c8run src/cpu.cpp src/display.cpp src/keyboard.cpp src/main.cpp src/mmu.cpp src/vm.cpp)
target_link_libraries(c8run ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})

# Chip8 disassembler
add_executable(c8dasm src/disassembler.cpp src/c8dasm.cpp)

# Chip8 assembler
add_executable(c8asm
               src/c8asm.cpp
               src/asm/parser.cpp
               src/asm/arithm.cpp
               src/asm/jump.cpp
               src/asm/load.cpp
               src/asm/logic.cpp
               src/asm/misc.cpp
               src/assembler.cpp
)
```

To compile any Chip8 assembly source file:

```bash
$ c8asm <asm file> <binary file>
```

## Conclusion

Over the last 2 months or so, we reviewed and implemented how an emulator works, build a disassembler
and finally a compiler. Even if the Chip8 is not the latest piece of technology on the market, it's still a good
playground to learn the ropes of emulation. We hope you learn something in the journey and enjoy it as much as we did.

Happy coding and see you next time.
